One-click carbon offsetting for E-commerce and consumers

## Description ##

Neutral Cart is targeting actors that have the WooCommerce plugin installed and want to show that their company takes responsibility for the environment. The plugin offers a way for consumers to carbon offset their digital purchases with a simple press of a button. Neutral Cart takes care of the rest.

*How does it work?*
1. By installing Neutral Cart you'll give your customers the opportunity to carbon offset all the purchases they make through your store.
2. Neutral Cart will provide a checkbox at the WooCommerce checkout page that analyzes the customer's cart and suggests a reasonable amount that reflects the carbon footprint of their purchase
3. The user can accept the suggested amount simply by checking the checkbox
4. The user will continue the checkout using the store's standard payment process
5. Neutral Cart will summarize and report the total carbon offset amount and invoice the store owner monthly or after a reasonable total amount has been reached.
6. All carbon offset donations will be invested carbon offsetting project certified by the [Gold Standards Organization](https://www.goldstandard.org/) and Neutral Cart will take a small commission for the service.
